# 🤖 AI-Powered Code Analyzer



A smart JavaScript code analyzer that detects bugs, security issues, and best practice violations without requiring external APIs.



## ✨ Features



- **Quality Scoring** - 0-10 scale code quality assessment

- **Issue Detection** - Identifies bugs, security risks, and performance problems

- **Best Practices** - Checks coding standards compliance

- **Code Refactoring** - Automatically generates improved code

- **Detailed Reports** - Exportable JSON reports

- **Offline Operation** - No API keys or internet required



## Quick Start



### Installation

```bash

# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Sharada-PujariE/ai-code-analyzer.git

cd ai-code-analyzer



# Install dependencies (none required for core functionality)

npm install

```



### Usage

```bash

# Run the analyzer

npm start

```



##  Sample Output

```

🤖 AI CODE ANALYZER

Analyzing JavaScript Code...



⭐ QUALITY SCORE: 5/10

📈 STATUS: ❌ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT



🚨 ISSUES FOUND:

&nbsp;  1. \[High] Bug Risk - Using loose equality (==)

&nbsp;  2. \[Medium] Best Practice - Using "var" instead of const/let

&nbsp;  3. \[Low] Modernization - Traditional for-loops



💡 IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:

&nbsp;  - Use const/let for better scoping

&nbsp;  - Replace == with === for type safety

&nbsp;  - Modernize with Array methods



✅ Report saved to report.json

```



##  How It Works



The analyzer performs static code analysis by:



1. **Pattern Matching** - Detects anti-patterns and code smells

2. **Best Practice Checks** - Validates against JavaScript standards

3. **Quality Scoring** - Calculates score based on issues found

4. **Auto-Refactoring** - Suggests improved code versions

##  Detected Issues

-  `var` usage (should use `const`/`let`)
-  Loose equality `==` (should use `===`)
-  Traditional loops (should use Array methods)
-  Missing error handling
-  Magic numbers
-  Short function names



## Future Enhancements



- Multi-language support (Python, Java, C++)

- AI-powered suggestions using LLMs

- IDE integration (VS Code extension)

- Real-time analysis

- Team collaboration features

- Custom rule configurations
